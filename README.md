# Core-Backend [BETA]

## Description

* REST and GraphQL API that allows users and companies to centralize their user, roles and applications management into a single API that handles everything. 
* The idea behind the project is to avoid creating a business logic to log users each time a new app is created. 
* So, the development is and will continue being centered in the flexibility to customize everything you need. PR's and suggestions are welcome. 
* I'll be versioning the API as soon as I consider it's ready for put in production.
